# Important for installation
Here I'll be writing a mini-guide for how to install FiveM's server files to make my app work properly.

1. Head over to FiveM's <a href="https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/">artifacts</a> site.
2. Hit the **Latest Recommended** button. (It's in big blue)
3. Open the new `server.zip` folder and drag its contents into the `huemp\Main\Server` folder.
4. Head over to FiveM's <a href="https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data">cfx</a> repo.
5. Hit the **Code** button and then hit **Download as ZIP**.
6. Open the new `cfx-server-data-master.zip` folder and drag its contents into the `huemp\Main\cfx-server-data-master` folder.
7. Profit. If something went wrong, repeat step 1-6 carefully.
