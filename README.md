# Important for installation
Here's a mini-guide for how to install FiveM's server files to make my app work properly.

1. Head over to FiveM's <a href="https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/">artifacts</a> site.
2. Hit the **Latest Recommended** button. (It's in big blue)
3. Open the new `server.zip` folder and drag its contents into the `huemp\Main\Server` folder.
4. Head over to FiveM's <a href="https://github.com/citizenfx/cfx-server-data">cfx</a> repo.
5. Hit the **Code** button and then hit **Download as ZIP**.
6. Open the new `cfx-server-data-master.zip` folder and drag its contents into the `huemp\Main\cfx-server-data-master` folder.
7. Profit. If something went wrong, repeat step 1-6 carefully.

# Huemp
Refreshed and revamped update for my tool **FXServer Creator** which has been renamed to **huemp**.\
Refer to <a href="https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/fxserver-fivem-server-creator">gta5-mods.com</a> for the original page.

Huemp is my new and updated version of the old **FXServer Creator** tool which you can find using the link above. Below you'll find comparisons between old and new, as well as changes in how the app works and what has been added. Do note that there are still changes planned that will take some time, which is why I'll be releasing the current stage first.\
